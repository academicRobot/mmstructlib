Heidelberg, April 19th, 1995

Dear collegue,

Thank you very much for your interest in the papers

"The Double Cubic Lattice Method: Efficient Approaches to Numerical
Integration of Surface Area and Volume and for Generating Dot Surfaces
of Molecular Assemblies"
published in Journal of Computational Chemistry, v. 16, N3,
(1995), pp.273-284 by Frank Eisenhaber, Philip Lijnzaad, Patrick Argos,
Chris Sander, and Michael Scharf 

and the associated program NSC (version 2.0). 

The program NSC can be obtained by academic users free of charge
if they agree with an academic license agreement (of non-redistribution).
Commercial users are asked to pay a symbolic fee
(please sign a commercial user agreement). The text of the license
agreements is contained in "readme.nsc".

The program text in standard C for UNIX systems can be obtained from the
author in the following way:
(1) ftp phenix.EMBL-Heidelberg.DE;
(2) login: anonymous, during login give your E-mail address as password;
(3) change to the directory pub/NSC.2;
(4) move all files of this directory to your site
(5) execute 
      uncompress nsc2.tar.Z
      tar -xvf nsc2.tar
      cd NSC.2
(5) read "readme.nsc" for further information

Please, contact me by E-mail, if you have suggestions, problems
or questions. Please ask, if you do not find nsc2.tar.Z at the ftp-site.
In this case, I will renew the file.

The program has an interesting numerical surface calculation
algorithm which is one of the
fastest techniques known to me on UNIX work stations by using a single
processor.

Sincerely,


Frank Eisenhaber
